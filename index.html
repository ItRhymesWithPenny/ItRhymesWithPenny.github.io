<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>My name is Jennifer Patterson and I am a software developer 
    with over 10 years of professional experience.  
    I will be updating this site in the coming weeks with projects and 
    tutorials showcasing my web development capabilities.</p>
<p>Below, I added a few buttons which do rather nonsensical and impractical things!</p>
<button onclick="window.alert('Look; a popup window!')">Trigger A 
    Popup Window for no reason</button>
<button onclick="window.print()">Print this page</button>
