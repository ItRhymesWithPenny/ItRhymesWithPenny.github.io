    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <!-- Giving a rather dorky introduction, here -->
    <p>My name is Jennifer Patterson and I am a software developer 
        with over 10 years of professional experience.  I have an advanced level knowledge of
        <ul>
            <li>C#</li>
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>MS SQLServer</li>
        </ul>
        I will be updating this site in the coming weeks with projects and 
        tutorials showcasing my web development capabilities.</p>
    <!-- Provide demo functionality -->
    <p>Below, I added a few buttons which do rather <strong>nonsensical</strong> things!</p>
    <button onclick="window.alert('Look; a popup window!')">Trigger A 
        Popup Window for no reason</button>
    <button onclick="window.print()">Print this page</button>
